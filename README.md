## LSAclassifier
#Document Classifier based on LSA. Final project for Information Retrieval class. 

We decided to implement a document classifier in Python, which is based on Latent Semantic
Analysis. As our source data, we used Reuterâ€™s dataset. Beside Python as our programming
language, we used tools like: sklearn library, pandas library, BeautifulSoup, re library, and
ipynb notebook.
